# MCPg feature roadmap

Forward-looking candidates for new feature work, grouped by
area. Each entry shows rough effort (**S** / **M** / **L**),
user-facing value, and any prerequisite. Use this as a menu for
prioritisation.

Items that are already on `main` are deliberately **not** listed
here — for what shipped when, see
[`../CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md). For the live status of
security-hardening items specifically, see
[`security-hardening.md`](security-hardening.md).

Effort scale (rough, single-session yardstick):

- **S** — 1 module, 1 PR, ≤ 1 day equivalent
- **M** — 2–3 modules or wider surface, 1–3 PRs
- **L** — new infrastructure (background workers, transport
  changes, cross-cutting refactors)

---

## 1. Observability

| # | Item | Effort | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | ✅ **Shipped.** OpenTelemetry tracing — one span per `call_tool` invocation behind the `mcpg[otel]` extra. Spans live on the `mcpg.tools` tracer and carry `mcp.tool.name`, `mcp.tool.argument_count`, `mcp.tool.status`, plus `error.type` / `error.message` on failure. Raw argument values are deliberately not attached (PII / secrets). Standard `OTEL_*` env vars (endpoint, headers, sampler) take precedence; `MCPG_OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` is the only project-specific knob. Lives in `mcpg.otel_tracing`. | M | Medium-High | One span per `call_tool` + child spans for the actual query / subprocess. |
| 1.2 | Structured JSON logging output toggle | S | Medium | Wraps the existing `mcpg.audit` logger. |
| 1.3 | ✅ **Shipped.** Slow-call logging from the MCP layer | S | Low | Per-tool latency log to flag slow MCPg-side calls (the existing `analyze_workload` covers PG-side timings). |

## 2. PostgreSQL feature coverage

| # | Item | Effort | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | Logical replication management writes (`create_publication`, `drop_publication`, `create_subscription`, `drop_subscription`) | M | Medium-High | Read tools already exist. Closes the loop on logical-replication ops; gated under `MCPG_ALLOW_DDL`. |
| 2.2 | ✅ **Shipped.** `pg_buffercache` integration (cache hit analysis at the buffer level) | S | Low-Medium | Niche. |
| 2.3 | ✅ **Shipped.** WAL inspection (`pg_walinspect`) | S | Low | Niche but useful for replication debugging. |
| 2.4 | ✅ **Shipped.** Deeper `pg_locks` walker — deadlock-cycle reconstruction beyond the current `find_blocking_chains` pair list | S-M | Medium | Live-ops complement. |

## 3. Developer experience

| # | Item | Effort | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3.1 | ✅ **Shipped (first wave).** Auto-generated tool examples in MCP tool descriptions — the `_with_example(description, example)` helper in `mcpg.tools` wraps every wrapped description with a canonical pseudo-Python invocation hint (``Example: `tool(arg=value)```). ~25 high-traffic tools across introspection / query / composite / health / search / diagrams / schema-diff / vector analytics / migrations / data movement now ship examples. The helper is the contract for new tools. | S | Low-Medium | Helps agents pick the right tool. |
| 3.2 | ✅ **Shipped.** Sample-data generator that writes (`seed_table_with_sample_data`) | M | Medium | Sibling of the current `generate_test_data` (synthetic INSERT statements; does not execute). Gated under WRITE. |

## 4. Security & compliance

The full security-hardening roadmap (HTTP request limits, security
headers, CORS allowlist, audit-log HMAC integrity chain, pluggable
secrets backend, subprocess hardening, graceful shutdown) lives in
[`security-hardening.md`](security-hardening.md). Forward items
not covered there:

| # | Item | Effort | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4.1 | ✅ **Shipped.** Connection-encryption verification tool (`verify_connection_encryption`) — reports `ssl` + protocol/cipher/bits for MCPg's own link plus a cluster-wide encrypted/unencrypted backend tally, from `pg_stat_ssl`. | S | Medium | Composes with the existing TLS-enforcement startup check. |
| 4.2 | ✅ **Shipped.** Audit-log retention via `prune_audit_events(older_than_days)` — deletes old `mcpg_audit.events` rows (cron-friendly). Refuses when `MCPG_AUDIT_INTEGRITY` is on, since pruning would break the HMAC chain. | S | Medium | — |
| 4.3 | ✅ **Shipped.** IP allowlist for HTTP transport (`MCPG_HTTP_IP_ALLOWLIST`) — comma-separated IP / CIDR list, validated at boot. Tiny ASGI middleware sits at the outermost layer so denied clients never reach the auth / size-limit stack. `X-Forwarded-For` is intentionally not honoured (spoofing); reverse-proxy deployments should enforce there. Lives in `mcpg.http_runtime`. | S | Low | Tiny middleware. Often handled at the reverse-proxy layer instead. |
| 4.4 | ✅ **Shipped.** TLS / mTLS for the HTTP transport (`MCPG_HTTP_TLS_CERTFILE` / `MCPG_HTTP_TLS_KEYFILE` / `MCPG_HTTP_TLS_CA_CERTS` / `MCPG_HTTP_TLS_CLIENT_CERT_REQUIRED`) — uvicorn terminates TLS itself; with `client_cert_required=true` + a CA bundle it's full mutual TLS. Cross-validated at boot (cert+key both set, mTLS needs CA, paths must exist). Lives in `mcpg.http_runtime`. | S | Medium | Cert wiring; commonly done at the proxy layer. |

## 5. Backups & DR

| # | Item | Effort | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5.1 ✅ | Scheduled logical backups via `pg_cron` + `dump_database` | S | Medium | Shipped as `schedule_logical_backup`: composes `cron.schedule` with `COPY TO PROGRAM 'pg_dump ...'`. Tight allowlist on `destination`/`pg_dump_path`/`database`. PostgreSQL-superuser-only at runtime. |
| 5.2 | WAL archive inspection | M | Low | Niche; only useful where WAL archiving is configured. |
| 5.3 | Point-in-time recovery prep helpers | M | Low-Medium | Heavy lift for a narrow audience. |

## 6. Schema design / quality

| # | Item | Effort | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 6.1 | ✅ **Shipped.** `recommend_index_drops` — sibling of `recommend_indexes` for what to drop. Walks `pg_stat_user_indexes` + `pg_stat_user_tables` for indexes that look like pure cost. Three reason codes (descending strength): `never_used` (idx_scan = 0), `scan_no_fetch` (planner picks it but it returns no rows — existence-check pattern), `rarely_used` (scan rate below `low_scan_ratio` of the table's total scan activity). Excludes primary/unique/exclusion-constraint indexes. Returns a ready-to-run `DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY` per candidate. Lives in `mcpg.indexing`. | S | Medium | Sibling of `recommend_indexes`. |

## 7. Migration ecosystem integration

| # | Item | Effort | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 7.1 | ✅ **Shipped (first cut).** `list_unapplied_migration_scripts` — walks a Flyway / Alembic / Liquibase scripts directory and cross-references each script's identifier against the framework's history table (`flyway_schema_history` / `alembic_version` / `databasechangelog`). Reports pending + applied with a one-line first-comment preview per script. `available=false` distinct from `pending_count=0` for greenfield databases. Filesystem access is gated by `MCPG_MIGRATION_SCRIPTS_ROOTS` (refuses every path by default). DDL-gated. Lives in `mcpg.migration_ingestion`. Execution via `prepare_migration` is the natural follow-up. | M-L | Medium | Big agentic win for projects with existing migration history. |
| 7.2 | ✅ **Shipped.** Pre-deployment migration validation (target schema vs production snapshot) | M | High | Composes `compare_schemas` + shadow workflow. |
| 7.3 | ✅ **Shipped.** Migration history table integration (read Alembic / Flyway / Diesel native tables) | S | Medium | Reads existing tooling's bookkeeping. |
| 7.4 | ✅ **Shipped.** Zero-downtime migration cookbook | S | Medium-High | Pure docs (patterns, not code). |

## 8. AI / agent-specific

| # | Item | Effort | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8.1 | Test-data factory using catalog + heuristics (`generate_test_row_for(schema, table)`) | M | Medium-High | Pairs with the shadow-migration workflow. |
| 8.2 | ✅ **Shipped.** Schema-documentation generator (Markdown table reference from catalog) | S | Medium | Sibling of `generate_schema_diagram`. |

## 9. pgvector extensions

Building on the already-shipped `vector_search`,
`vector_range_search`, `hybrid_search`, `recommend_vector_index`,
`recommend_vector_quantization`, `analyze_vector_search`,
`analyze_vector_table`, `describe_table` vector-dimension
awareness, and HNSW/IVFFlat detection in `list_indexes`:

| # | Item | Effort | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 9.1 | HNSW recall/speed tuner (`analyze_hnsw_recall`) — sweep `ef_search` against a ground-truth set, return recall@k curves | M | High | Lets agents pick the right speed/quality knob without manual tuning. |
| 9.2 | ✅ **Shipped.** `mmr_search` — Maximal Marginal Relevance re-ranking on top of vector_search for result diversity. `lambda_mult` trades relevance for diversity; cosine over candidate embeddings, metric-independent. | S-M | Medium-High | Quality of agentic RAG flows. |
| 9.3 | ✅ **Shipped.** `cluster_vectors` — k-means (Lloyd + k-means++ seeding) over up to 5000 sampled rows of an embedding column. Returns centroids + per-row assignments; deterministic via `seed`; `metric` supports `l2` (default) or `cosine` (vectors normalised, centroids re-normalised each iteration). Lives in `mcpg.vector_ops`. | M | Medium-High | Exploration / segmentation tool. |
| 9.4 | ✅ **Shipped.** `detect_vector_outliers` — k-means clusters the sample (same engine as `cluster_vectors`) and flags rows whose distance to their cluster centroid sits more than `zscore_threshold` (default 3.0) standard deviations above the per-cluster mean. Singleton clusters automatically flag their lone member. Returns outliers sorted by z-score (capped at `max_results`), unclipped `total_outliers`, and per-cluster mean / std stats. Read-only; `available=false` without pgvector. Lives in `mcpg.vector_ops`. | S-M | Medium-High | Data quality + content moderation. |
| 9.5 | ✅ **Shipped.** `monitor_embedding_drift` — samples a baseline + current window of an embedding column (filtered by a timestamp column), computes the per-dimension centroid and L2-norm distribution of each, and reports the cosine distance between the two centroids plus relative changes in the norm mean/std. `drift_detected` flips when cosine distance exceeds `drift_threshold` (default 0.05). Windows are half-open `[start, end)`. Returns `insufficient_data=true` distinctly from `drift_detected=false` when either window is empty. Read-only; lives in `mcpg.vector_ops`. | M | Medium | Ops / model-quality monitoring. |
| 9.6 | ✅ **Shipped.** `import_vectors` — bulk-load embeddings from JSON/CSV into a pgvector `vector(N)` column; reads the declared `N` from the catalog and validates every row before any INSERT runs. Optional parallel `id_column`. | S | Medium | Sibling of `import_csv` specialised for vector columns. |
| 9.7 | ✅ **Shipped.** `cross_table_similarity` — locates a row in table A by id, then issues a pgvector k-NN against table B. Catalog-verifies both columns are `vector(N)` with matching N up front so dimension mismatches fail with a clear error. Lives in `mcpg.vector_ops`. | S | Medium | Useful for entity resolution / linking across tables. |
| 9.8 | ✅ **Shipped.** `analyze_distance_metric` — samples up to 1000 rows of an embedding column, computes the L2-norm distribution, and recommends cosine / l2 / inner_product (pre-normalised → inner_product; constant magnitude → cosine; variable magnitude → cosine). Lives in `mcpg.vector_ops`. | S | Medium | Concrete advice when the user hasn't decided yet. |
| 9.9 | ✅ **Shipped.** `monitor_index_build` — surfaces every active `CREATE INDEX` from `pg_stat_progress_create_index` (PG12+), with resolved `schema.relation.index_name`, phase label, and a computed `progress_pct` (blocks first, tuples as fallback). Lives in `mcpg.liveops`. | S | Medium | Lives next to `list_active_queries`; useful for big-table index work. |
| 9.10 | ✅ **Shipped.** `migrate_vector_to_halfvec` — read-only DDL planner that converts a `vector(N)` column to `halfvec(N)`. Reads the column's type + dimension + row count + every index from the catalog and emits an ordered `migration_sql` plan (drop affected indexes, `ALTER COLUMN` via `USING col::halfvec(N)`, recreate each index with its `halfvec_*_ops` sibling) plus a mirror `rollback_sql`. Returns `already_halfvec=true` (empty plan) when the column is already at the target type, and refuses any ANN index whose opclass has no halfvec sibling rather than rewrite it incorrectly. Caller is expected to validate via the shadow-migration workflow before applying. Lives in `mcpg.vector_tuning`. | S-M | Medium | Pairs with `recommend_vector_quantization`. Uses the existing shadow workflow. |

## 10. pg_turboquant integration

The full phased plan lives in
[`plans/pg_turboquant-integration.md`](plans/pg_turboquant-integration.md).
The cross-backend retrieval-quality and rerank-analytics work that
composes with this lives in
[`plans/rag-efficiency-suite.md`](plans/rag-efficiency-suite.md).

| # | Item | Effort | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10.1 | ✅ **Shipped (TQ-1).** Read advisors for [pg_turboquant](https://github.com/mayflower/pg_turboquant): `list_turboquant_indexes`, `get_turboquant_index_metadata`, `get_turboquant_heap_stats`, `get_turboquant_last_scan_stats`. Defensive JSON parsing — documented fields are typed; the full upstream payload is preserved in `raw_metadata` / `raw` so future-added fields stay reachable. Each index info also carries `index_options` — the `WITH (...)` build-time options (`bits`, `lists`, `transform`, `normalized`) parsed from `pg_class.reloptions` into typed values. Returns empty list / `None` when the extension is absent. Lives in `mcpg.turboquant`. | S | Medium | Mirrors how `cron` / `partman` are surfaced. `pg_turboquant` added to `ENABLEABLE_EXTENSIONS`. |
| 10.2 | `turboquant_approx_candidates` + `turboquant_rerank_candidates` + `recommend_turboquant_query_knobs` — query-execution wrappers around the dedicated `tq_*_candidates(...)` functions so callers actually exercise the extension's SIMD fast path (the pgvector operators may not), plus the per-query knob advisor. Composes the TQ-1 `tq_last_scan_stats` helper to include scan diagnostics in the response. Promoted ahead of 10.3/10.4/10.5 because it both unblocks adoption and is a hard prerequisite for the RAG efficiency suite's turboquant arm (11.1). | M | High | TQ-5 — the new ordering puts this right after TQ-1. |
| 10.3 | `recommend_turboquant_maintenance` advisor + `audit_turboquant_indexes` category wired into `audit_database` — `format_v1_reindex_needed`, `maintenance_due`, `fast_path_ineligible`, `delta_tier_large` rules. | S-M | Medium-High | TQ-2. |
| 10.4 | `maintain_turboquant_index` — write tool wrapping `tq_maintain_index`; pre-flight confirms the named index is actually a turboquant index. Unrestricted-only. | S | Medium | TQ-3. |
| 10.5 | `create_turboquant_index` + `reindex_turboquant_index` — DDL tools with bits/lists/transform/normalized allowlists and a single-source-of-truth metric→opclass mapping (`tq_cosine_ops` / `tq_inner_product_ops` / `tq_l2_ops`). Unrestricted + `MCPG_ALLOW_DDL`. | M | Medium-High | TQ-4. |

## 11. RAG efficiency suite

Cross-backend retrieval-quality + cross-encoder rerank analytics.
Full design plan in
[`plans/rag-efficiency-suite.md`](plans/rag-efficiency-suite.md).

| # | Item | Effort | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 11.1 | `analyze_vector_search_efficiency` — one report, three backends (HNSW / IVFFlat / turboquant). Sweeps a candidate-multiplier axis mapped to the right per-backend knob (`ef_search` / `probes` / `rerank_limit`); reports recall@k, Spearman ρ + Kendall τ, p50/p95 latency, pages-pruned (turboquant), bytes-per-indexed-row; emits findings (`baseline_recall_low`, `rerank_lift_flat`, `rerank_lift_steep`, `ranking_degraded`, `pruning_ineffective`, …). Zero instrumentation cost. | M | High | Phase A of the suite. |
| 11.2 | `audit_vector_indexes` category — tiny per-index sweep folded into `audit_database`. | S | Medium | Phase B. |
| 11.3 | `mcpg_rag.rerank_events` schema + `setup_rag_telemetry` + `log_rerank_event` — caller-populated event table for cross-encoder analytics. `query_hash` as the join key keeps PII out by default. | S | Medium | Phase C. Adoption ask; rewards instrumentation with phase-D analytics. |
| 11.4 | `analyze_reranker_lift`, `analyze_topk_stability`, `analyze_rerank_score_distribution`, `analyze_rerank_ndcg`, `recommend_rerank_strategy`, plus `audit_rag_pipeline` category. | M | High | Phase D — "is my cross-encoder earning its latency budget, or is it theatre?" |

## 12. Multi-database support

| # | Item | Effort | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 12.1 | One MCPg server, multiple `MCPG_DATABASE_URL`s — tool-level db selector | L | Medium | Today: one server = one DSN. Multi-DB means a per-tool param, a pool-per-DB, and rethinking gates. Big lift; no concrete demand yet. |

---

## Currently deferred (no commitments)

- **Multi-database support** (10.1 above) — very ambitious;
  preferred shape today is one MCPg instance per database.
- **Backups & DR** beyond what `dump_database` /
  `restore_database` already cover — narrow audience.
- **Alembic / Flyway / Liquibase script ingestion** (7.1) — large
  surface; `validate_migration` + `prepare_migration` already
  cover the high-value reviewer workflow.
